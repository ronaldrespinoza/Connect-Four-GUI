# Connect-Four-GUI

* This was a team project to make a Connect Four GUI using Java and JFrame
* Currently a Max-Min algorithm is used by the PC to predict the best move for the computer
* Note: Position blocks are also used to override the best move

The game starts with a blank board allowing the Human to play first

Checks are then ran after each piece placement to determine the winner:

* Example where the Human Wins
